- uvicorn~=0.29.0
- httpx~=0.27.0

### Notes

In the end I still don't know what async is but I learned the python Springboot.

I understand that request should be handled by a delicated thread so that the main thread wouldn't get blocked. However I don't understand the performance difference (or this tutorial intended to use async because it is needed, not because it is better).

Finally it made into my recommendation... Async basic I should have learned before the previous video.
