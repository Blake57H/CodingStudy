# Daily Coding Problem: Problem #40 [Hard]

Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

This problem was asked by Google.

Given an array of integers where every integer occurs three times except for one integer, which only occurs once, find and return the non-duplicated integer.

For example, given [6, 1, 3, 3, 3, 6, 6], return 1. Given [13, 19, 13, 13], return 19.

Do this in O(N) time and O(1) space.

## My solution

I can't think of a O(N) solution. So I checkout the answer online.

----

O(?) time complexity and O(?) space complexity.

## Googled solution (if I actually googled it)

It counts the bit at every position. Find the bits that doesn't divide by 3. Construct those bits back and get the number.

Pretty smart in my opinion.
