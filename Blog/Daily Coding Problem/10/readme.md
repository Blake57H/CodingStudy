# Daily Coding Problem: Problem #10 [Medium]

Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

This problem was asked by Apple.

Implement a job scheduler which takes in a function `f` and an integer `n`, and calls `f` after `n` milliseconds.

## My solution

Sleep for n milliseconds?

Or use Async to achieve parallel job execution?
