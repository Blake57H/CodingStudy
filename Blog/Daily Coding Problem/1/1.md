# Daily Coding Problem: Problem #1 [Easy]

Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

This problem was recently asked by Google.

Given a list of numbers and a number k, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to k.

For example, given [10, 15, 3, 7] and k of 17, return true since 10 + 7 is 17.

Bonus: Can you do this in one pass?

## My solution

1. Create a hashset.
2. Iterate the array, say the item is `i`, if `i` is in hashset, return true and loop ends.
3. Else, subtract `i` from `k`, save the result to the hashset.
4. Repeat step 2 until array exhausted.
5. Return false.

----

I believe this solution is O(n) time complexity and O(n) space complexity. Donno if there is a better solution (needs subscription fee to see the answer).

Also my solution can complete in one pass.
