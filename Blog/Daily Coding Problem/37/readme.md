# Daily Coding Problem: Problem #37 [Easy]

Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

This problem was asked by Google.

The power set of a set is the set of all its subsets. Write a function that, given a set, generates its power set.

For example, given the set `{1, 2, 3}`, it should return `{{}, {1}, {2}, {3}, {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {2, 3}, {1, 2, 3}}`.

You may also use a list or array to represent a set.

## My solution

Solve it with recursive steps.

For the input set, result will include the set itself and its sub-set. Remove one element and recursively solve its subset.

O(?) time complexity and O(?) space complexity.
