# Daily Coding Problem: Problem #33 [Easy]

Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

This problem was asked by Microsoft.

Compute the running median of a sequence of numbers. That is, given a stream of numbers, print out the median of the list so far on each new element.

Recall that the median of an even-numbered list is the average of the two middle numbers.

For example, given the sequence [2, 1, 5, 7, 2, 0, 5], your algorithm should print out:

```python
2
1.5
2
3.5
2
2
2
```

## My solution

I can imagine a data structure that only stores the value close to the middle to save memory.

Which will absolutely doesn't work.

Maybe linked list with both-side pointer?

1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
5. 

----

O(n) time complexity (due to value insertion) and O(n) space complexity (cause I'm recording the value).

## Googled solution (if I actually googled it)
