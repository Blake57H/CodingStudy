# Daily Coding Problem: Problem #19 [Medium]

Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

This problem was asked by Facebook.

A builder is looking to build a row of N houses that can be of K different colors. He has a goal of minimizing cost while ensuring that no two neighboring houses are of the same color.

Given an N by K matrix where the nth row and kth column represents the cost to build the nth house with kth color, return the minimum cost which achieves this goal.

## My solution

My English is so bad that I spent 10 minutes to understand the problem.

1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
5. 

----

O(?) time complexity and O(?) space complexity.

## Googled solution (if I actually googled it)

It seems I have to go through all possibilities before I can tell the lowest cost.
