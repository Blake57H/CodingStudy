# Daily Coding Problem: Problem #32 [Hard]

Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

This problem was asked by Jane Street.

Suppose you are given a table of currency exchange rates, represented as a 2D array. Determine whether there is a possible arbitrage: that is, whether there is some sequence of trades you can make, starting with some amount A of any currency, so that you can end up with some amount greater than A of that currency.

There are no transaction costs and you can trade fractional quantities.

## My solution

I donno how to get started...

All I could think of is multiplying array[i][j] and array[j][i] and see if the result if greater than 1.

----

O(?) time complexity and O(?) space complexity.

## Googled solution (if I actually googled it)
